# Fairness-Improving-Machine-Learning
ML in linear logistic regression in python 

• Implemented a convolutional neural network with Python PyTorch module to perform a binary
classification on a multi-feature dataset using logistic loss function
• Increased the fairness of the classification by adjusting weights on different subgroups and adding
regularization terms to the classifier to lower the FNR discrepancy
• The final model achieved 88% prediction accuracy and 8.5% FNR discrepancy
